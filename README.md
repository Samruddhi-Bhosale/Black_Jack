Game Rules
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more beneficial.
If you exceed 21, you bust and lose the game.
If you get a score of 21 with your first two cards, it's a Blackjack!


How to play:
Start the Game: Run the script using Python.
Receive Your Cards: You will be dealt two cards, and the dealer (computer) will also receive two cards, with one card hidden.

Decide Your Move:

You will see your cards and your current score.
The dealer's first card will be visible.
You can choose to:
Hit: Type 'y' to receive another card.
Stand: Type 'n' to end your turn.
Dealer's Turn: After you stand, the dealer will reveal their cards and must hit until their score is 17 or higher.

Determine the Outcome: The game will compare scores:

If your score exceeds 21, you bust and lose.
If the dealer busts, you win.
If you both have scores, the higher score wins. If tied, itâ€™s a draw.
Game End: The result will be displayed, and you can choose to play again by restarting the script.
